# Phase 0: Research & Clarification

**Status**: Blocked
**Date**: 2026-01-17

This document outlines the research and clarifications required to proceed with the implementation plan for the AI-Powered Todo Chatbot. The planning process is currently **blocked** due to missing critical input documents.

## 1. Missing Input Specifications

The following specification documents, mentioned in the user request, could not be found in the project:

-   `@specs/api/mcp-tools.md`: **Critical**. This file is required to define the API contracts for how the AI Agent interacts with the Managed Control Plane (MCP) tools. Without it, the entire Agent-to-backend interaction cannot be designed.
-   `@specs/database/chat-schema.md`: **Critical**. This file is required to define the data models for conversations and messages, which are essential for designing the database interactions and the `data-model.md` artifact.

## 2. Missing Guiding Document

The user request specifies that the project must "Follow Hackathon II Phase III PDF strictly". This document is essential for understanding the high-level requirements, constraints, and architecture that must be followed.

-   `Hackathon II Phase III PDF`: **Critical**. This document could not be found in the project. Without it, any plan generated would be based on assumptions and would likely deviate from the core project requirements.

## Next Steps

To unblock the planning process, please provide the three missing documents. Once they are available, I can proceed with generating the complete implementation plan and design artifacts.
